        <p>A twelve card spread that looks at the emotional, mental and spiritual aspects of life in the
          past, the present, the future, and why their interconnectedness is important. It effectively provides a
          snapshot in time as to where the querent is in their current emotional, mental, and spiritual cycles today and
          where they are heading. In addition it looks at the current life lesson/cycle.</p>

        <p>Card #4 should be looked at as representing how well the lessons of the past have been learned. Card #8 is
          interpreted as how successfully the present is being used to inform the future. If the card is negative or
          neutral, then it indicates what changes need to be made. If the card is positive then affirm that the querent is on
          the right path, but consider whether improvements could still be made and if so, what they are. Cards #9, #10
          and #11 represent the current snapshot of the future if recommended changes are made (if card #8 is negative
          or neutral) or if the current path is maintained or improved upon (if card #8 is positive).</p>
