        <p>Deal card 1. If this card is interpreted as there being no problem at present then omit cards 2, 3, 4,
          5 and go straight on to dealing card 6. If card 6 shows a problem then deal cards 7 to 10. If card 1 does show
          a problem then deal cards 2 to 5. The reading can be stopped at that point, or cards 6 to 10 can be
          dealt in addition to consider other future problems.</p>
