        <h4 class="padding">Key Phrases</h4>

        <p>1. Emotional upheaval. Anger and rage.</p>

        <p>2. Survival instincts.</p>

        <p>3. Destruction, aggression and conflict.</p>

        <p>4. Being uncomfortable. Being exposed.</p>

        <p>5. Experiencing the shocking truth.</p>

        <p>6. Sudden awakening.</p>

        <p>7. Being freed from the Tower of illusion.</p>

        <p>8. Blessing in disguise.</p>


        <h4 class="padding">Meanings</h4>

        <p>The Tower card represents disaster, emotional ‘meltdowns’ and/or tantrums, anger issues, upheaval and sudden change that was caused by disruption and revelations rocking the foundation of the person, household, organization or even country, depending on the nature of the question. When the Tower is showing up it's to let you know that you must face the truth about a situation, or you'll have an issue with being able to have positive changes in your life. Living in illusion is not going to work. You might fall off cloud nine and rediscover who you are; someone who is less likely to be fooled, lied to or taken advantage of. You are a whole lot less naive after the shocking effect of the Tower. The Tower shows up to free you from what is enslaving you. Shattering as it is, it also gives you flashes of genius and epiphany moments. These moments of truth act as a catalyst for spiritual awakening, and when the high run of emotions is mellowing out you will look back and see it all happened for the best. In the long run the Tower will save you from a spiritual and emotional destitution.</p>

        <p>In a love reading the Tower signifies a toxic relationship filled with conflicts. If the querent is
          single the Tower can mean they are dealing with abandonment issues.</p>

          <p>In a career reading the Tower signifies jobs with high emotional pressure. </p>

        <h4 class="padding">Personality Types</h4>

        <p>The Tower characterizes someone who is ready to shake up the status quo. They often have emotional
          outbursts and behave in a way that rocks the foundation of relationships, families, work places and
          organizations. Wherever they go they rock the boat, often by revealing truths and secrets. This is someone who
          has arguments, altercations and drama wherever they go. They are activists, hackers and anarchists,
          confronting and attacking old and out dated structures.</p>

      <div class="padding">
        <h4 class="padding">Key Phrases</h4>

        <p>1. Avoiding confrontations.</p>

        <p>2. Hiding the truth.</p>

        <p>3. Stupefying.</p>


        <h4 class="padding">Meanings</h4>

        <p>The Tower reversed exposes secrets and lies that would have brought down the false structures, but they remain hidden, and there is no shake up. There is no destruction and the Tower remains standing. The querent might not want to
          face facts, as it will create too many changes in their life. Things will remain in the dark, and
          someone or something is preventing the truth from coming out. The false residents find their way back in, the
          lies are not revealed and the liars get away with it. Sometimes the Tower shows up reversed when the truth is
          about to be revealed, but the liars are too powerful, and the lightening that should have thrown them out of
          power is instead aimed at the innocent. They will not be believed, and the Tower remains. Sometimes the Tower
          shows up reversed when the querent is feeling overwhelmed and out of control.</p>


        <h4 class="padding">Personality Types</h4>

        <p>The Tower reversed is someone who is concerned about survival, and is feeling overwhelmed on many levels. They display uncontrollable anger and are unstable. This is someone who
          can be a danger to themselves and others. They might have experienced a trauma that keeps them in an unhealthy
          pattern. They need more love in their lives, so that they can start letting go of their trauma without feeling
          so alone and abandoned.</p>

        <p>The Tower is ruled by the planet Mars, the same planet that also rules the Emperor. In the Tower we see the
          more destructive aspect of Mars. Emotional outbursts and anger issues are indicated. Unexpected events that
          throw the querent off-balance are denoted.</p>

        <p>The Tower is square, and the crown being knocked off it is circular, revealing that the knocking off of the crown
          was exactly what was needed, as a circle will never fit comfortable on a square in the first place. The 22
          flames represent the 22 Major Arcana cards. 
        </p>

        <p>The gray reports a matter suppressed and in fear of exposure. The lightning symbolizes bolts of truths. The
          lightning travels from left to right, illustrating the subconscious reaching the conscious, evoking a moment of sudden
          awakening. The tower built on the uneven mountain represents ambition built on unsound premises.</p>

        <p>The two figures seen falling to either side, a man in a blue tunic and a woman in a red cape, are freed from the chains seen in the Devil card. The background is black which links it further to the Devil
          card, which has the same dark setting. The darkness seen in the Devil card is now being cleansed and purified
          with fire, wind and rain.</p>
